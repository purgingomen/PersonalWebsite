			<h2>Cohesion vs. Currency</h2>
			<h3>April 22, 2013</h3>
			<p>We need to start working for each other rather than against each other. We need to champion teamwork more so than competition.</p>
			<p>This needs to be a cultural change- greed and the endless pursuit of profit need to stop being our primary motivators. Rather, the want to see our neighbors succeed and flourish, despite our differences, should be measurable and sought after.</p>
			<p>I can only hope to live to see the day when cohesion is valued more than currency.</p>

			<h2>Free Labor: Unpaid Internships</h2>
			<h3>April 22, 2014</h3>
			<p>The existence of unpaid internships is something that has always frustrated me for a few reasons. Students coming out of college need experience, yes, but they do not need companies preying on their desperation by offering “experience” without pay. Work should be reimbursed with pay, regardless of the relationship. Companies that try to hide their exploitation behind carefully crafted descriptions of what their interns will “gain” are acting immorally and unethically (or are just delusional).</p>
			<p>The onus should never be on a student, fresh out of college, to bear the financial burden of an unpaid internship. If you are a hiring manager for a company in need of someone to do legwork, then contribute to the economy by paying these students a wage.</p>
			<p>Another negative social aspect of unpaid internships is how they perpetuate opportunity disparity. A student who does not have the financial capability to sustain him/herself through an unpaid internship is effectively shut out from taking on an unpaid internship. A student whose well-off family can support their travel to the city every day thus has access to more opportunities (because they do not have to worry about finances). This, combined with the privileges inherent to being born into a well-to-do family, stack the odds for success strongly against the financially struggling student.</p>
			<p>Unpaid internships should be abolished and replaced with, at minimum, minimum wage “experience gained” positions. A for-profit company should expect to pay for services provided by an “intern” just as they would expect that intern to pay for a product that the very same company provides.</p>

			<h2>Parallel Lives: Eight Years (and Counting) of Love and Warcraft</h2>
			<h3>July 26, 2013</h3>
			<p>It all started with a few simple words from a (real life) friend of mine during my first year of high school. We were eating lunch and he stopped mid-bite of his sandwich to utter this simple but life changing monologue: “Hey man, you should try World of Warcraft. I think you’d like it.” I was apprehensive at first- to me, a massive multiplayer online role playing game (MMORPG) was the furthest thing from what I wanted to “waste” my free time on- but little did I know that it wouldn’t be a waste at all.</p>
			<p>It’s been eight years since that fateful day, and as I reflect upon my entire experience with WoW, I hold nothing but good thoughts. I’ve met a handful of people whom I would consider close friends, despite having met them via the internet. Without WoW I would have never even stood a chance of coming in contact with them (these are people from New Zealand, Japan, California, and the Deep South). I’ve conquered challenges with those friends, all while sitting on a quite comfortable chair! I’ve yelled at them for screwing up (and then subsequently made the same mistake), and I’ve felt the adrenaline rush of accomplishing something that can only be accomplished when forty people come together to lay the smack down on an intricately arranged pile of pixels. I’ve done all this while (gasp) being in a relationship. How, you say? I’ll explain…</p>
			<p>About the same time that I began my adventures in Azeroth, I met a beautiful girl who would later become my girlfriend. I’m still with her today, and although I can feel her eyes roll when I make a WoW reference, I know they are rolling with uncontrollable love! This is relevant because had she not been so tolerant of my hobby, who knows if I would ever have enjoyed so many great years of love (and Warcraft). You see, there is a thing called raiding in WoW (that I referenced earlier when I mentioned laying the smack down to pixels) in which you and your group gets together on some type of schedule to attempt some sort of near impossible task. Specifically for me, this meant consistently logging on to WoW on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights from 9pm to 12pm. This went on for more than four years, and I did this all while that special someone was reading a book behind me or making fun of the stupid things my group of friends would say over our microphones to each other.</p>
			<p>If we were to go out, the possibility of missing a raid was always a factor. She knew this and we would work to accommodate. I’m not saying it is easy to compromise, but it makes sense to. Some partners may dismiss their significant others interest in video games as an invalid excuse to not go out each night. I don’t think this is healthy for a relationship, and in not following that missive, our relationship flourished. For instance, let’s say my WoW group was doing something particularly difficult on a given night that they expected me to be around for. Just that afternoon however, my g/f and I might have discussed going into the city for the night. What we would do is simple: talk about it. Never once would she or I act like one course of action was more important than the other. We would take all factors into consideration and make a decision together. Sometimes that would mean going into the city if there was an exhibit she wanted to see, and sometimes that would mean staying home if my WoW group was at the cusp of getting over a hurdle that we had been struggling on for a week or two. We learned to hate that we loved each other’s interests, and it only made our relationship stronger.</p>
			<p>You see, interests are unique to an individual and as such, each individual can find value in things that someone else may not readily (or ever) see. What makes humans great is that we have the capability to understand this (and within rationality) be accepting and respectful of what others choose to do with their free time. This is especially important in a relationship.</p>
			<p>In summary, some people may say you can’t do something like play an MMO and maintain a healthy relationship. Some people may say that you’re setting yourself up for disaster if you think your significant other is going to tolerate your “childish” hobby. They may say that there is no value in playing an MMO and that it is a waste of time. I would argue against all of those points and say that none of that bullshit matters. All that does matter is that you and your significant other both enjoy each other’s company, that you both respect each other’s interests, and that you understand that even though you see no value in their hobby, they do, and you should embrace that as something that you value.</p>

			<h2>The Right Side of History</h2>
			<h3>May 10, 2013</h3>
			<p>Love. It’s an emotion most of us feel at some point in our lives (I would hope). It’s a powerful emotion; one that can bring people together from all sorts of backgrounds and one that can transcend socio-economic status, class, race, and ethnicity. Yet it is an emotion that is still being debated. I’m talking of course about the right to marry a significant other of the same sex/gender.</p>
			<p>Now some might argue that you can still experience love without marriage. They might say that the right to marry is one that should stay exclusive to those who choose to marry someone of the opposite sex. I even hear the argument that it is all just semantics, and that those in same sex relationships should be happy with a “civil union” in order to obtain the same rights given to those that are married.</p>
			<p>I don’t like any of these arguments and I feel strongly that they are rooted in division and discrimination. Marriage affects none other than those that are bonded by it. It is a symbol of love and one that should be granted to all consenting adults who seek it, regardless of sex/gender. If it is as simple as semantics, then why not just let others enjoy the same “title” as you? The answer seems to be because people want to make themselves feel better or more important than a certain segment of society (in this case, gays).</p>
			<p>It’s sickening to think that people want to strip this symbol of such a powerful emotion away from those that wish to shout it loud and proud. If you can’t take seeing two people have the same rights and privileges as you, you’re growing up in the wrong era and are on the wrong side of history.</p>

			<h2>Discovery</h2>
			<h3>May 2, 2013</h3>
			<p>Some people are lucky enough to discover what they are good at early in their life. Others have to continuously fail at new things until they find their purpose. Still others may never find something that they excel in. Throughout my (admittedly short) life I have met people that fall under all three of these categories, while still hoping to discover what it is that I enjoy doing (preferably while making a living).</p>
			<p>While I envy those that can hit the ground running because of an innate talent, I know that those that fail from time to time, or those that drift through life never discovering what they were “meant” to do, all serve a purpose. No matter who you are or what you feel you have or have not accomplished, you have certainly affected someone’s life somewhere along the line for the better. Whether it was your reassuring words in response to someone’s relentless venting of their frustrations, or that noticeably simple smile on your face while people passed you by on a busy street, we all have held the capability to make a positive impact on someone else’s day.</p>
			<p>So if you are still struggling to discover your talents and your dreams, remember that you have nothing to prove. Keep smiling, keep laughing, and keep enjoying your life. The rest will fall into place.</p>

			<h2>Boundaries</h2>
			<h3>May 2, 2013</h3>
			<p>We all have boundaries: limits on what we think we can achieve or what the world has told us we can or cannot. I think that today those limits are even more defined as the bar of entry for opportunities continues to rise. What those on the outside looking in tend to forget is that we all are not molded and developed in the same way. Some of us are born into worlds of chaos that are unimaginable to those that have not had a similar experience. Some of us lack the funds to discover passion, or lack that simple but important push (or pull) to achieve and succeed. What I have come to discover is that, if given the chance, people can do some pretty unexpected things. So the next time someone comes to you with passion in their eyes, and you are in a position to help them achieve their dream, ignore your prejudices and take a risk. You never know, you just might break a boundary and make the world a better place.</p>

			<h2>Thinking Back</h2>
			<h3>May 2, 2013</h3>
			<p>Thinking back to my teenage years I remember lots of things: I remember the NJ Devils winning the Stanley Cup at the turn of the millennium; I remember Iron Man being my favorite superhero strictly because of a trading card I had of him (I’ve never read a single comic); and I remember endless nights of grinding and raiding in World of Warcraft with only tired eyes to show for all my efforts the next day in school. Most of all however, I remember the excitement: the excitement of that long smile and hug you get after driving back and forth for a long distance relationship; the excitement of getting those keys for the car you beat to hell with all that driving; and the excitement of learning about different potential interests.</p>
			<p>The long smiles and learning don’t have to stop, but somehow through the daily grind or through growing up they lose their meaning or, more importantly, that energizing feeling you get from them. If I could offer one piece of advice, it would merely be to hold onto that excitement, because it is the true reason for living. If you take the time to sincerely think about why you smile when you see the person you love, or why your body shakes with anticipation when you’re watching a press conference for the new iPhone (sadly comparable, I know), then you’ll learn a lot more about yourself than any hobby or job can ever teach you.</p>
